Musical Instrument Inventory Program

This program is designed to keep track of my current musical instrument inventory, the current market value, and any other relevant information.  

Running the program will bring in my DefaultInventory, which you can then examine. Within each instrument individually, you can update the "Vale" and "Other" fields. From the main 
menu, you can add new instruments or remove instruments.
